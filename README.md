## 🖥️ Description
A personal portfolio website designed and developed to showcase my work in **3D & 2D design** and **creative development**.  
This project blends visual design, front-end code, and interaction to present a clean, elegant and professional identity.  
It was inspired by the minimalist and structured aesthetic of [PLD Space](https://www.pldspace.com/es) and complemented with modern design ideas from [Dribbble web design tags](https://dribbble.com/tags/web).

The website is built using **only HTML, CSS and JavaScript**, following naming conventions and responsive layout requirements for desktop, tablet and mobile.
